# gtainpython
A "recreation" of GTA in Python and Pygame. 
Music by Jason Shaw, title is Big Car Theft on Audionautix. 

## How to run on Windows (Make sure you have Python istalled, either from the [official website](python.org) or Microsoft Store): 
1. First, download the game using the green button, then choose Download ZIP. 
2. Use your favorite archiving software (even Windows) to extract it.
3. Then, go to the newly extracted folder, open a terminal (right-click on the empty space in Explorer, then click `Open in Terminal`)
4. In the terminal window that opens, type `pip install pygame`. Unfortunately, it's needed to make the game run. It simply installs the required library. Wait until the installation is finished. 
5. Next, in the same window type in `python main.py`. It executes the python code and opens the game window.
6. Enjoy!

## How to run on Linux or MacOS:
